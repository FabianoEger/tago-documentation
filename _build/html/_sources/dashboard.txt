Dashboard
*********

A dashboard is where you place your widgets to visualize and interact with data, in realtime. All of your dashboards are listed on the sidebar of Tago.

You can organize them in a way that best fit your needs by moving and resizing your widgets.

Sending dashboards
==================

Sometimes a dashboard can become an entire feature that you want to share. Now there are two ways of sending a dashboard to someone:

* :ref:`dashboard-share`
* :ref:`dashboard-copy`

.. _dashboard-share:

Share
-----

When you share your dashboard, others can only visualize it. They will not be able to move, resize, or even edit widgets. They will also have access only to the variables that you added on it.

To **share** a dashboard with someone, you must access that dashboard and then, through the **Dashboard options** menu, click in **Share**.

.. raw:: html

	<video style="max-width: 100%;" src="_static/dashboard/dashboard_share_1.mp4" autobuffer controls></video><br><br>

To complete the action, fill the email of whom you want to share your dashboard. Then optionally write him/her a message.

.. raw:: html

	<video style="max-width: 100%;" src="_static/dashboard/dashboard_share_2.mp4" autobuffer controls></video><br><br>

In that screen you can also visualize the list of people which you already shared that dashboard. From there, you can also stop sharing your dashboard by clicking the trash can.

.. raw:: html

	<video style="max-width: 100%;" src="_static/dashboard/dashboard_share_3.mp4" autobuffer controls></video><br><br>

.. _dashboard-copy:

Copy
----

When you send a copy of your dashboard, others will only receive the dashboard without having any access to your data. They are able to edit the dashboard and its widgets without impacting yours.

To **copy** a dashboard to someone, you must access that dashboard and then, trough the **Dashboard options** menu, click in **Share**.

.. raw:: html

	<video style="max-width: 100%;" src="_static/dashboard/dashboard_copy_1.mp4" autobuffer controls></video><br><br>

To complete the action, fill the email of whom you want to copy your dashboard to, optionally write him/her a message and then describe the type of devices that are needed for that dashboard. (we automatically gather the devices used by your dashboard and show you just what you need to describe)
