Bucket is your storage tool; all data received from your devices or subscriptions are stored here. You may create as many buckets as you wish. Letâ€™s create one for the Power generator device.

First, access the Tago Admin and click on Data on the sidebar. Then, click on Add new bucket blue button.

Now, enter with the bucket name and description. You can edit the fields later if needed.
