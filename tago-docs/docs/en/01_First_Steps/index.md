Hi, to introduce you the Tago features, let’s start with a hands on example. In this example, let’s create a full ecosystem that communicates with an emergency power generator localized in Chicago, Il.

The following real-time information will be obtained:

* Fuel level
* Oil pressure
* Battery level
* Running hours
* Location

Also, we will setup actions that will be triggered when some variables reach a defined value. In this case, Tago will send an SMS to the operating manager when the Fuel level is lower than 10%.

Let's do this!
